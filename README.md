# 👋🏻 Welcome to my GitHub profile!
My name is Arya. I'm a 14 year old guy from Iran. I enjoy coding and playing video games. In my free time, I generate random ideas and work on them. I have over 50 cool projects that are lost on the Internet.
I joined Discord in 2021 and started learning about it, It didn't have a lot of features but it was still a great application. Then I started to create Discord servers and bots, Some successful projects and some random stuff.
